            <h3>Let's make a better world just by keeping our planet clean.</h3>
            Every year we put trillions of tons of plastic in the ocean only. We pollute our planet in many ways (like
            polluting the air, water & mud). But plastic is one of the biggest among them. Every day 8 million pieces of
            plastic find their way into the ocean. There are almost 46,000 pieces of plastic in every square mile of
            ocean.
            The weight of those plastics is 269,000 tons. This is the average amount. So, it's very important to stop
            polluting the ocean. Along with the reduction of plastic usage around us. We need to clean the oceans not
            just
            to save marine life by also to save ourselves.
